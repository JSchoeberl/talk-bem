    "For $x > n$, both Bessel functions are oscillating,  with amplitudes decreasing like $1/x$. For $x < n$, the $j_n$ are extremely small, while $y_n$ are extremely large. This explains the unstable behaviour of the recursion for the $j_n$. We use the recusion in $n$. For $n \\leq x$, the $j_n$ are $O(1)$, but for $n > x$ they become very small. Unavoidable roundoff errors for small $n$ lead to huge relative errors for the higher $n$. High quality implementations compute the recurrence backward, where it is stable, and also take care of leaving the range of floating point numbers, see e.g. the implementation from [FMM3D on github](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/FMM3D/blob/master/src/Common/besseljs3d.f)"
